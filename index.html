        <p>
            My name is David Downey, and I am a reliable, energetic, and resourceful programmer 
            with a strong interest in Web Development. I enjoy learning how websites are built 
            and how they can be used to solve real-world problems. Web Development excites me 
            because it combines creativity with technology, giving me the opportunity to design 
            and build applications that are both useful and engaging. I also have experience 
            with computer hardware and programming, which strengthens my ability to understand 
            how technology works from the ground up.
